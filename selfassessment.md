# Professional Self-Assessment

## Narrative

The main purpose of this ePortfolio is to serve as a representative of my growth in computer science program.  Throughout the program, I have learned and acquired core concepts of computer science including but not limited to software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, databases, collaboration in team environment, and communication to stakeholders.  Course such as CS-310 Collaboration and Team Project assisted my skill development in team project collaboration.  I acquired skills in uploading, downloading, committing project via repository, and professional team communication methods.  For software design and engineering, I was able to learn agile, waterfall, scrum, and Devops software development methods from CS-250 Software Development Life Cycle.  I also acquired software testing skills such as Junit test, black box testing, and white box testing from CS 320 course of Software Testing, Automation, and quality assurance.  Algorithms and data structure vary from programming languages.  Throughout my computer science program, I was able to proficiently write programs on multiple languages such as Java, C++, Python, SQL, PHP, and HTML.   For data structure, CS 260 Data Structure course taught me how write program utilizing different types of data structures, such as array, linked list, record, trees, stack, reference, and queue.  Lastly, courses such as DAD 220 Introduction to SQL, DAT 220 Fundamentals of Data Mining, and CS 340 Advanced programming concepts equipped me with skills in manipulating databases and processing/presenting large data sets.  I can create, read, update, delete database utilizing SQL and PHP language.  With large dataset, I can find anomalies, patterns, and correlations to predict outcomes and as well as formulate summary to present to stakeholders.  

Within is ePortfolio, I will present three artifacts that I have worked on that will demonstrate my capability in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases.  These three artifacts serve as an update to the original authentication system I have created a while back when I first started computer science program.  An overview of Authentication System project is to take in userâ€™s username and password input.  Then compare those credentials with existing credentials under MD5 hash on a text file.  If the credentials match, the system will display appropriate content from other text files that match with user job roles.  
The first artifact is the improvement software appearance in term of implement it with Java graphical user interface.  I will be able to display my skills in: implementation of Java SWING library, displaying Java language knowledge, implementation of MD5 hash string, usage of pseudocode to segment functionality of software, solve logic problems and implement them in software, applying coding best practices, employ iterative algorithm, implement classes in a way that could apply to future changes to classes and objects, find potential security vulnerabilities or bugs from project, fix potential security vulnerabilities and bugs, create industry-standard software design.

The second artifact involve hashing algorithm, data structure, and updating complexity of project.  Original MD5 hashing algorithm will be replaced with SHA-256 hashing as well as the addition of register user function.  For this second enhancement I will be displaying skills such as: articulate approach to solving complex logic, employing various data structures when constructing program, design simple object-oriented with data abstraction and information hiding, implementation of SHA-256 hash, usage of software libraries, compilers, editors, and debuggers to produce effective software, and display understanding of essential semantic structures of programming language such as values, ty pes, storage, control flow, and etc.

The third artifact involve with database and database manipulation.  The program will switch from text file data storage to database storage via locahost and SQL language.  I will be able to display my skills such as: implement approach to ensure data are explicitly validated, implementation of database, display mySQL techniques CRUDs and query concepts, implementation of java to database cross platform, arrays and control structures with database, and implementation of external database software such Xampp and PHP.
