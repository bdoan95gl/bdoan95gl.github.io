# Informal Code Review

## About Informal Code Review

Code review is the process of consciously and systematically check codes for bugs and errors.  It not only provides a fresh perspective to review codes but also reduce the amount of work required later for quality assurance personnel or testers.  There are multiple reasons for why code review is essential in computer science profession.  Code review ensures consistency in design and implementation of program.  By having code review done by peer or using another perspective, it requires coders to make source code readable and easy to understand by someone else who might get introduced to the source code.  If the coders use their own style of coding, such as unclear variable naming, it will result in disjoint team collaboration.  Hence, code review allow consistency in design and implementation.  

This informal code review is done based upon my original authentication system program created using Java language.  The program has not been through any enhancements for this informal code review.  It includes how the program originally work, plans for enhancement in three categories: software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases.  This code review will demonstrate my skills and outcome in term of generating code-review experiences, perform individual code reviews, provide contextual and explanation for codes, provide different decisions on software improvement via code reviews, provide code walk through, program purpose, and generate collaborative experiences.
